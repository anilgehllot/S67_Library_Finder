# S67_Library_Finder

**Project Title:**  
**Public Library Finder**  

**Project Overview:**  
This project aims to create a web application that helps users find public libraries near their current location. The application will provide users with detailed information about nearby libraries, including their address, opening hours, available services, and contact details. The goal is to promote accessibility to community resources and encourage reading and learning by making it easy for people to locate libraries.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Location-based Library Search**: Automatically detect the user’s location or allow manual input of a location to search for nearby libraries.  
- **Library Information Display**: Show detailed information about each library, including address, hours of operation, and available facilities.  
- **Interactive Map**: Display library locations on a map using markers for visual navigation.  
- **User Reviews and Ratings (Optional)**: Allow users to read and submit reviews for libraries to help others choose.  
- **Library Service Filter (Optional)**: Filter results based on specific services, like free Wi-Fi, study rooms, or children’s programs.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for responsive design.  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.  
- **Database**: MongoDB or Firebase for storing library data.  
- **APIs**: Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap for location services.  
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for tracking changes.  

**Why This Project:**  
I chose this project because public libraries play an important role in providing free educational resources and community support. Creating a library finder tool helps raise awareness of these vital institutions and makes them more accessible. Through this project, I will develop key skills in web development, including API integration, frontend design, and backend server management. Additionally, working with location-based services and maps will enhance my experience with interactive, user-centric features in web applications.
